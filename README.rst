About
=====

This example shows how to deploy the NIST Fingerprint dataset_ (Special Database 4) and tools_ (NBIS) to the cluster.
Additionally, this demonstrates how to use Apache Spark to perform a fingerprint matching using the NBIS tools, store the results in HBase and use Apache Drill to query the results.

--------------
 Introduction
--------------

Fingerprint recognition refers to the automated method for verifying a match between two fingerprints and that is used to identify individuals and verify their identity.
Fingerprints (Figure 1) are the most widely used form of biometric used to identify individuals.

   **Figure 1** Example fingerprints



The automated fingerprint matching generally required the detection of different fingerprint features (aggregate characteristics of ridges, and minutia points) and then the use of fingerprint matching algorithm, which can do both one-to- one and one-to- many matching operations.
Based on the number of matches a proximity score (distance or similarity) can be calculated.


------------
 Algorithms
------------

For this work we will use the following algorithms:

- MINDTCT: The NIST minutiae detector, which automatically locates and records ridge ending and bifurcations in a fingerprint image. (http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/nbis.cfm)
- BOZORTH3: A NIST fingerprint matching algorithm, which is a minutiae based fingerprint-matching algorithm. It can do both one-to- one and one-to- many matching operations. (http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/nbis.cfm)

----------
 Datasets
----------

We use the following NIST dataset for the study:

- Special Database 14 - NIST Mated Fingerprint Card Pairs 2. (http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/special_dbases.cfm)

===============
 Prerequisites
===============

In order to run this example, you need to have the following on your system:

#. Python 2.7
#. Pip
#. Virtualenv
#. Git

Additionally, you should have access to a cloud provider (such as OpenStack or Amazon Web Services).
Any instances need to be accessible via SSH and have Python 2.7 installed.

#. Cloud provider

**Note**: Your controller node needs to be able to run Ansible.


============
 Quickstart
============

If you want to get started quickly here is what you need to do.

**note**: We assume the login user is ``ubuntu``, you may need to adjust the ansible commands to accomodate a different user name.


#. Have an account on github.com

#. Upload you public ssh key to `github.com <https://github.com/settings/keys>`_

#. Clone this repository::

     $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:cloudmesh/example-project-nist-fingerprint-matching

   **IMPORTANT**: make sure to include the ``--recursive`` flag else you will encounter errors during deployment.

#. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies::

     $ virtualenv venv
     $ source venv/bin/activate
     $ pip install -r big-data-stack/requirements.txt

#. Start a virtual cluster (Ubuntu 14.04) with at least three nodes and obtain the IP addresses. We assume that the cluster is homogeneous.
#. In the ``big-data-stack`` directory, generate the ansible files using ``mk-inventory``::

     $ python mk-inventory -n mycluster 192.168.1.100  192.168.1.101 192.168.1.102 > inventory.txt

#. Make sure each node is accessible by ansible::

     $ ansible all -o -m ping

#. Deploy the stack (~ 20 minutes)::

     $ ansible-playbook play-hadoop.yml addons/{spark,hbase,drill}.yml -e drill_with_hbase=True

#. Deploy the dataset and NBIS software (~ 10 minutes)::

     $ ansible-playbook ../{software,dataset}.yml

#. Login to the first node and switch to the ``hadoop`` user::

     $ ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.100
     $ sudo su - hadoop

#. Load the images data into HBase (~ 2 minutes)::

     $ time spark-submit \
         --master yarn \
         --deploy-mode cluster \
         --driver-class-path $(hbase classpath) \
         --class LoadData \
         target/scala-2.10/NBIS-assembly-1.0.jar \
         /tmp/nist/NISTSpecialDatabase4GrayScaleImagesofFIGS/sd04/sd04_md5.lst

#. Run MINDTCT for ridge detection (~ 20 minutes)::

     $ time spark-submit \
         --master yarn \
         --deploy-mode cluster \
         --driver-class-path $(hbase classpath) \
         --class RunMindtct \
         target/scala-2.10/NBIS-assembly-1.0.jar

#. Sample the images to select subsets as the probe and gallery images. In this case the probe set is 0.1% and the gallery set is 1% (~ 2 minutes)::

     $ time spark-submit \
         --master yarn \
         --deploy-mode cluster \
         --driver-class-path $(hbase classpath) \
         --class RunGroup \
         target/scala-2.10/NBIS-assembly-1.0.jar \
         probe 0.001 \
         gallery 0.01

#. Match the probe set to the gallery set (~ 2 minutes)::

     $ time spark-submit \
         --master yarn \
         --deploy-mode cluster \
         --driver-class-path $(hbase classpath) \
         --class RunBOZORTH3 \
         target/scala-2.10/NBIS-assembly-1.0.jar \
         probe gallery

#. Use Drill to query::

     $ sqlline -u jdbc:drill:zk=mycluster0,mycluster1,mycluster2;schema=hbase

     > use hbase;
     > SELECT
       CONVERT_FROM(Bozorth3.Bozorth3.probeId, 'UTF8') probe,
       CONVERT_FROM(Bozorth3.Bozorth3.galleryId, 'UTF8') gallery,
       CONVERT_FROM(Bozorth3.Bozorth3.score, 'INT_BE') score
       FROM Bozorth3
       ORDER BY score
       DESC
       LIMIT 10
       ;

==============
 Installation
==============

#. Clone this repository::

     git clone --recursive git@github.com:cloudmesh/example-project-nist-fingerprint-matching

#. Create a virtualenv and activate it::

     virtualenv venv
     source venv/bin/activate

#. Install the requirements::

     pip install -r big-data-stack/requirements.txt


====================
 Build Instructions
====================

These instructions are for manually building and bundling the source
code for loading the images into HBase and running the analysis::

  $ sbt package
  $ sbt assembly


====================
 Running with Spark
====================

After building, the target jarfile to submit is located at::

  target/scala-2.10/NBIS-assembly-1.0.jar


When submitting, you need to tell Spark to provide HBase in the execution classpath using::

  --driver-class-path $(hbase classpath)

------------
 Components
------------

There are four components that are run with Spark:

#. Loading the image data into HBase
#. Running MINDTCT for ridge detection
#. Partitioning into probe and gallery sets
#. Running BOZORTH3 for comparing probe and gallery sets


In the command below the ``$MAIN_CLASS`` and ``$MAIN_CLASS_ARGS`` configure which component to run and arguments passed in.
The possible configurations are

- ``MAIN_CLASS=LoadData``

  This runs the component that loads the data from local filesystem
  into HBase.

  Arguments: ``path`` (required): the path to the checksum file.
  This is the file from which the list of images and their metadata files is extracted. For example::

    MAIN_CLASS_ARGS=/tmp/nist/NISTSpecialDatabase4GrayScaleImagesofFIGS/sd04/sd04_md5.lst

- ``MAIN_CLASS=RunMindtct``

  This runs the component to find the ridges in the images by forking
  off the ``MINDTCT`` program to process each image and store the
  results in HBase.

  Arguments: None

- ``MAIN_CLASS=RunGroup``

  This subsamples the image database into "probe" and "gallery" sets.
  You must specify how much of the full dataset to use for each set.
  For example: 0.1% for "probe" and 1% for "gallery" below::

    MAIN_CLASS_ARGS="probe 0.001 gallery 0.01"

  The number of images to be included in a set is given by::

    count = multiplier * total_images

  Arguments:

  #. ``nameProbe`` (required): the name of the probe set, **eg**: ``probe``
  #. ``multiplierProbe`` (required): subsample the full dataset by this value, **eg**: ``0.001``
  #. ``nameGallery`` (required): the name of the gallery set, **eg**: ``gallery``
  #. ``multiplierGallery`` (required): subsample the full dataset by this value, **eg**: ``0.01``

- ``MAIN_CLASS=RunBOZORTH3``

  This applied the ``BOZORTH3`` program to the images chosed by the grouping step.
  You must specify the names of the probe and gallery sets.
  For example::

    MAIN_CLASS_ARGS="probe gallery"

  Arguments:

  #. ``nameProbe`` (required): the name of the probe set, **eg**: ``probe``
  #. ``nameGallery`` (required): the name of the gallery set, **eg**: ``gallery``

   
--------------------------------
 Local Submission (for testing)
--------------------------------

::

   spark-submit \
     --driver-class-path $(hbase classpath) \
     --class $MAIN_CLASS \
     target/scala-2.10/NBIS-assembly-1.0.jar \
     $MAIN_CLASS_ARGS

-------------------------------------
 Cluster Submission (for production)
-------------------------------------

This is the same as the local submission, but add::

  --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster
